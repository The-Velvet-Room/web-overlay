web-overlay
===========

OBS's built-in overlay tools are too easy, so why not run a node.js project?

For best results, use with the [CLR Browser Source plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/) for OBS.

How to run
==========
1. Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Clone the repo change directory to the repo's root.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `DEBUG=web-overlay bin/www` to start the project.
